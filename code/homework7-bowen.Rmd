## Exercixe 6.2 (K&J)

First, let's load the data
```{r}
data(permeability)

```

First, we'll filter **out** any sparse predictors with the `caret::nearZeroVar` fucntion
```{r}
filteredPredictors <- nearZeroVar(fingerprints)

length(filteredPredictors)
```

We went from 1,107 predictors to 719 using this filtering, which should help in reducing our dimensionality. Next we can set up training and testing sets

```{r train-test}
train <- 
```
